#### I made this, It's a simple Tic Tac Toe game application for Android.
#### Here, I've learned how to use ImageView and TextView elements to create the game board and display game status.
#### I've learned how to implement the game logic for Tic Tac Toe, including:
##### Handling player taps on the game board.
##### Switching between X and O players.
##### Checking for win conditions based on the game state.
##### Resetting the game state.
#### I've learned how to design the game layout in XML (referenced by R.layout.activity_main), including placing ImageView elements for the game cells and a TextView element for displaying game status.
#### I've learned how to handle user taps on game cells (playerTap() method) and reset the game (gameReset() method) using event listeners.
#### I've used image resources (R.drawable.x and R.drawable.o) to represent X and O symbols in the game.
#### Overall, I've  acquired a basic understanding of creating a simple game application with user interaction and logic implementation in Android.
